# Searching for Mutations Leading to Isoniazid Resistance in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

This project explores the genomic mutations associated with Isoniazid (INH) resistance  in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The workflow includes data acquisition, quality control, read preprocessing, read mapping, variant calling, and mutation analysis.

## 🔧 Pipeline Overview

The pipeline processes paired-end FASTQ files to identify variants associated with INH resistance in *M. tuberculosis*:

1. **Data Acquisition**
2. **Quality Control**
3. **Read Trimming**
4. **Read Mapping**
5. **Sorting & Deduplication**
6. **Variant Calling**
7. **Variant Annotation**
8. **Mutation Analysis**

## 📦 Environment Setup

This project uses a Conda environment

### 1. Create the Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 2. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate tb_genomics
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod a+x scripts/*.sh
```

### 2. Execute the pipeline step-by-step:

```bash
# Step 1: Download raw reads and reference genome
bash scripts/download_data.sh

# Step 2: Run FastQC on raw reads

# Step 3: Trim adapters and low-quality reads
bash scripts/trim_reads.sh

# Step 4: Run FastQC on trimmed reads

# Step 5: Repair disordered reads
bash scripts/repair_reads.sh

# Step 5: Map reads to reference genome using BWA-MEM2
bash scripts/map_reads.sh

# Step 6: Sort and deduplicate BAM files using Samtools
bash scripts/sort_dedup.sh

# Step 7: Call variants using BCFtools
bash scripts/variant_call.sh
```

> ⚠️ Ensure that all required tools are installed and accessible in your system's `$PATH`.

## 📦 Data Access

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, input FASTQ files and intermediate outputs are **not included** in this repository.

To obtain the required data:

- Run `scripts/download_data.sh` which fetches all required files from public repositories, or  
- Manually download them using the accession numbers or URLs referenced inside the script
